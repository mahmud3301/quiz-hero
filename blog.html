                <p class="font-medium">map is used to transform elements, filter is used to select elements, forEach is
                    used to iterate over elements and execute a function, and find is used to find a specific element.

            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p class="font-medium">localStorage and sessionStorage are similar, but differ in their scope of data
                    storage and data accessibility. Cookies have a shorter lifespan and smaller data storage limit, but
                    can be accessed by server-side code and restricted to certain paths or subdomains. Each one has its
                    own use cases and benefits depending on the specific requirements of the application.</p>

                What is an event loop and how does it work?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p class="font-medium">The event loop is a mechanism that enables asynchronous and non-blocking
                    processing of code. <br><br>
                    The event loop works by continuously checking two queues: the call stack and the message queue. The
                    call stack is a data structure that stores a list of function calls that are currently being
                    executed. When a function is called, it is added to the call stack, and when it returns, it is
                    removed from the stack</p>

            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p class="font-medium">The chooseQuiz() function takes an index and a given answer as parameters and
                    updates an array called answers with a new object that contains the quiz data and the given answer
                    for that quiz. If an object with the same ID as the quiz being answered already exists in the
                    answers array, the function updates the answer for that object. If no such object exists, it adds a
                    new object to the answers array. Finally, the displayAnswers() function is called to update the user
                    interface with the updated answers array.</p>
